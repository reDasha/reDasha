### Hi, I'm Dasha ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I have significantly changed my life by becoming a developer.
- ðŸŒ± Now I am a junior developer at a large technology company and I am learning to improve in my new profession at School 21 (created in collaboration with the French School 42).
- ðŸŒ± This is my profile on the educational platform [Stepik.org](https://stepik.org/users/481404808/profile?preview=true).
- ðŸŒ± English (B2), Deutch (A2), Russian (native).
- âš¡ Fun fact: As a certified philologist, I enjoy studying languages (at the moment it's Python, Go, C/C++, SQL, PL/Plus, Groovy).
