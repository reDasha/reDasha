### Hi, I'm Dasha ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning to be a good developer at School 21 (created in collaboration with the French School 42, now just a Sber project). 
- ðŸŒ± This is my profile on the educational platform [Stepik.org](https://stepik.org/users/481404808/profile?preview=true).
- âš¡ Fun fact: As a certified philologist, I enjoy studying languages (at the moment it's Phyton, Go and C).
